## Project #1
https://github.com/slaz14/Project1

- <b>Description:</b> This project aims to create a survey analysis tool that asks users questions about their work arrangement, job satisfaction, age, and gender, and stores the responses in a Pandas DataFrame. The tool then filters the responses to include only valid entries, computes the mean job satisfaction and standard error of the mean for each work arrangement, and creates a grouped bar chart of mean job satisfaction by work arrangement using Matplotlib. Finally, the chart is saved in an Excel file using the openpyxl library. The overall goal of this project is to provide a simple and easy-to-use tool for analyzing survey data and visualizing the results.

## Project #2
https://github.com/slaz14/Project2

- <b>Description:</b> The code provided is an implementation of the Tic Tac Toe game using the Pygame library in Python. Pygame is a popular library for creating 2D games and multimedia applications in Python.

## Project #3
https://github.com/slaz14/Project3

- <b>Description:</b> The code is a Flask app that interacts with the Spoonacular API to provide recipe recommendations and the ability to save recipes to favorites. The code also includes a contact form where users can submit their name, email, and message.
